[2008-12-17]     laser amplitude noise coupling to DARM in RF and DC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Friday night we made measurements of the coupling of laser
amplitude (intensity) noise to DARM in an RF lock and in DC locks with
DARM offsets in both directions. These measurements were made by
injecting broadband noise into the laser intensity stabilization servo
(ISS) excitation (error) point, and then computing the transfer
function from the ISS monitor photodiode to DARM, correcting for both
the DARM_ERR calibration and the whitening of the ISS monitor
photodiode.

The scripts and data files from this measurement are located in
/data/dtt/tf/notebook/2008/12/12: noisetf.m, plot_olgans.m,
rf-iss-coupling.mat, dc-iss-coupling.mat,
dc-iss-coupling-negativeoffset.mat. The measurement times were
2008-12-12 18:59 (CST) RF, 2008-12-13 01:30 +DC, 02:45 -DC. In both DC
measurements there were 4500 counts DC on the TRANS PDs
(combined). The mean of ISS-ILMONPD_NW was 18410 counts.
