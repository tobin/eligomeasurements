This is the oscillator phase noise coupling data from Nicolas's SURF
project, summer 2005.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Do you have the OPN coupling data from your SURF report in a
    format that would be easy to include in the plot?  Is it the same
    as the data plotted in Stefan's thesis?

Attached, it's [frequency (Hz), magnitude (m/rad), phase
(degrees)]. Data below 40Hz is bad coherence. Stefan seems to have
more data points if you can ever get hands on his data.
